# minRouteCalculation
my final project
In this project I made an app that can calculte the best route for one person so he can go to all the points he would like in minimum time.
How I did it?
1) entering all places the driver want to go to within Google AutoComplete Places API .
2) add the places into disctance matrix . 
3) calculate the minimum route with implement of : Travelling Sales Mens Problem.
4) show the route on map. 
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>after calculate first go to 1 and then to 2</td>
     <td>register form</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
